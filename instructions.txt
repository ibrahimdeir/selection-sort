1.  Edit the file named "main.swift"
2.  Within this file, write a program which will sort the array of integers
    using Selection Sort.
3.  The output should be as follows:
    Pass: <p>, Swaps: <pass swap count>/<total swap count>, Array: [<comma-delimitted array contents>]
    For example:
        Pass 0, Swaps: 0/0, Array: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
        Pass 1, Swaps: 1/1, Array: [11, 25, 12, 22, 64]
